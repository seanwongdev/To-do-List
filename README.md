**This is a JavaScript mini project done without any frameworks to practice concepts learnt.**
- Reinforcing MVC model from scratch
- Making use of publisher-subscriber pattern between controller and views
- Use of advanced DOM, with some event propagation and delegation
- Localstorage to save the data between page reloads
